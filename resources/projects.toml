<p><i>Penguin</i> was a small tile-based puzzle game I first made in my senior year of
high school to help with college admissions. It was based on the sliding ice puzzles
of Pokemon's ice caves. The player controlled a penguin that could walk over ground, 
and could slide over ice until it hit an object. The goal was to reach a door at the
end of the level. Solutions involved paths that crossed over themselves multiple
times.</p>

<p>The project was done using Processing, a thin wrapper language around Java. It
took approximately 20 hours to program and create assets. Unfortunately, the original 
copy has been lost over the years. Since then I've made another version very similar
to the original, also in Processing.</p>
