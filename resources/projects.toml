Zachtronics is a game studio known for making games about programming.
However, another thing they're known for is solitaire. Each of their
programming games contains a custom-made solitaire minigame thematically
similar to the programming game. The solitaire minigames range from
moderately difficult to nearly impossible, and they don't avoid generating
unsolvable games. While playing the solitaire for one of their games
(Molek Syntez), I had a feeling that there was an algorithm to solve it.
This project is my attempt to implement that algorithm.

**Interactive Sudoku** is an app that helps players improve their Sudoku
skills. While there are many Sudoku apps out there, and many solvers as well,
this app is different. The app notices the techniques that the player is
using to solve puzzles, and how often the player is able to notice those
moves, and saves those as a profile of the player. The app then uses that
profile to provide targeted hints, and to generate puzzles that teach the
player new skills.

This project is a work in progress, and there are technical challenges
that I haven't resolved yet. I have basic Sudoku entering and playing
functionality, and I have a list of techniques to implement as part of the
skill recognition system. The rest has not been implemented yet.

properly draw outlines of those shapes. I was able to successfully overcome
that challenge, but lost interest in the project afterwards.
