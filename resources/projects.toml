brief = "A Covid screening survey for an orthodontist"
desc = """
During the summer of 2020, I was contracted by a local orthodontist, Doctor Serino,
to make website to screen patients for Covid symptoms. They were using an Covid
questionnaire created at the beginning of the pandemic for doctors that wasn't
configurable. The website was provided as-is, and wasn't updated after initial
creation. By summer, the questions were outdated, and important questions were
absent. I was asked to make a replacement questionnaire with certain extra features;
however, partway through the initial development, the company that provided the
original questionnaire released a new, updated service, at a cost far below what I
was contracted for, with all the requested features and configurability.
Unfortunately, the contract fell through.

The website was composed of two questionnaire pages, an administration page, a
database, email notifications sent to Serino's receptionist, and SMS notifications
sent to patients. The patient flow began with an SMS message sent by an appointment
reminder system that Serino used. The reminder message would contain a link to the
main questionnaire page. The on the main questionnaire page, patients entered
basic identifying info, and answered several questions about Covid symptoms,
exposure, travel outside the country, etc. Once submitted, those responses were
inserted into the database, and were checked for flagged answers (like responding
"yes" to recent exposure). A summary of the patient's responses were then emailed
to the receptionist, including either the flagged answers, or an all-clear message.
The night before the patient's appointment, an SMS message was sent to the patient
with a personalized link to the second questionnaire page. The second page was
visited by the patient when they arrived in the parking lot. The patient would
provide a description of their car, and possibly other questions if configured.
Finally, an SMS message was sent to the receptionist with the patient's responses.

The website that I made for the contract used several AWS services, to minimize cost.
The entire questionnaire was configured through an SQL database. The webpage was
rendered server-side by the Lightsail instance to minimize database network traffic
costs. The rendered HTML was hosted on a Lightsail instance, along with the
administration page. The administration page was able to edit the questions for each
questionnaire, and configure which responses were flagged. Questions could be either
a short text box, yes or no questions, or multiple choice with any number of options.
In order to comply with medical record storage regulations, database entries older
than a few days would be deleted, possibly first sending them to an email address.
JSON web tokens were used to generate personalized links sent to patients, and to
secure all REST endpoints. The Lightsail instance used endpoints to mediate all
communication between public facing web pages and the SQL database. The instance
used ExpressJS to serve endpoints, and Mustache to perform server-side rendering.

**Zork** is a classic text-based adventure game, and this project
partially re-implemented it in Rust. The original C source for the game is
available on the internet, but it's poorly commented with minimal variable
names. The first goal of the project was to learn more about the C Foreign Function
Interface (FFI) by implementing some functions in Rust and then linking the
binaries together. The second goal of the project was to practice reverse
engineering algorithms and legacy code.

I made an effort to not just blindly translate the C into Rust for each
function. Instead, I figured out what the function was doing, its purpose in
the game, and refactored the code as I translated it.

An issue that appeared early on was the difficulty of testing changes. I
was able to make unit tests for individual Rust functions, but integration
tests were done by manually playing the game. That didn't even work very well;
sometimes replacing a function would cause bugs to appear in code I hadn't even
looked at yet. To address these issues, I created an integration testing program
that recorded manual inputs and the original program's output text. It then ran
the C and Rust hybrid binary and checked the output against its recordings. The
recordings were large, so I stored them in a [separate repository](https://gitlab.com/Phlosioneer/zork-playback). With proper integration testing
set up, I made good progress.

I stopped the project when I reached the command processing code. It was too
tangled in unwritten assumptions, indirection, and hacky algorithms for me to

[projects.jmaker]
name = "JMaker"
brief = "Build system hybrid between Make and Gradle for Java projects with complex dependencies"
desc = """
**JMaker** was born from frustration with using Gradle for managing Java
projects with nonstandard setups. Gradle's design prioritizes sane defaults, and
build files should only need to describe deviations from the default project
structure. This philosophy works excellently for pure Java projects, but runs into
problems if the project mixes in other languages or dynamically generated resources.
It also has a hard time running arbitrary code as part of its build files. Although
it uses a programming language to define them, it only exposes an extremely small,
minimal API. Each plugin has an API, but the details are often undocumented. Finally,
it can have difficulties building an accurate dependency graph for unusual project
setups.

GNU Make has the opposite philosophy; it offers some defaults, but assumes very
little about how it's being used. Make excels at managing complex build processes
by using very robust bash integration and a well-defined dependency graph. However,
makefiles are described using a very old language with strange corner cases and limitations.
Notably, it has extreme difficulties handling commands, variable values, and bash commands
that include colons. The Java command-line compiler (javac) makes use of colons in
many of its commands, so Make has a hard time with Java.

JMaker was an effort to make a tool that could leverage the strengths of each,
with fewer downsides. It used Lua to define its configuration and commands, and uses
a rule-based production system like Make. That would allow it to have a clear and
well-defined dependency graph, with all the power of using an actual programming
language for build files.

I finished a fully functioning Lua parser and interpreter with custom syntax for recipe
definition. But work on the project stalled when writing the code to handle external
scripts. I learned how difficult it is to correctly start processes, capture their input
and output, manage environment variables, and handle crashed or unresponsive commands.
Make has built up a very robust system for calling executables and running bash scripts
that is extremely difficult to port to Java. It handles many corner-cases and works around
issues that I didn't even know existed until I tried to implement a similar system.

I started JMaker as part of my [Blue Lagoon](blue_lagoon) project. Gradle wasn't
able to understand some asset-generating scripts for tileset management. Unfortunately,
I wasn't able to get it working well enough to replace Gradle on that project.

# TODO: Upload to github!
name = "Python JVM Bytecode Editing Library"
brief = "Script to parse and modify Java bytecode files"
desc = """
Over the years, I've wanted to tweak Minecraft Mods slightly for
balance adjustments and custom behaviors. At first, I only wanted
to change a few static constants, but my requirements evolved over
time to include new behaviors and even rewriting some functions. In
the process of making python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks to patch
these files, I slowly built a bytecode editing library to make the
task simpler. I finally reached the point where it made more sense
to make a fully-featured library than repeated ad-hoc solutions.

There are no other python libraries for automatically manipulating
JVM files, so I combined all the knowledge I had accumulated into one
library and command-line utility. The basics were mostly done - parsing,
simple modifications, and repackaging the edited class files into a jar.
I created a patching system that used regex to decide which files to pull
out of a jar and which patches to apply to those files. I made a backup
system to save copies of the clean jar file before patching, and a command
to restore the backup if the patches went wrong.

The difficult part was stack frame analysis. Each Java method contains a
table of stack frames, which are used to typecheck the bytecode. Unlike
the rest of the class file format, the stack map table and stack frames are
very poorly documented. Many details are only specified in terms of a
Prolog verification program, which I had to reverse engineer to reveal the
specified behavior. Adding to the difficulty, stack frames are encoded in
an extremely strange, highly compressed format, with several special-cased
behaviors.

Even once the stack frames were parsed and re-serialized correctly, it
was very difficult to expose them to patch code in a convenient way. The
placement of the stack frames roughly follows a Basic Block breakdown of
the assembly code: each instruction that is a target of a branch must have
a stack frame entry. Frames are also needed whenever a new local variable is
defined, and local variables are stored in a stack format, so defining a new
local variable is not a simple process. The new local variable needs to be
put into a scope as defined by its placement in the local variable stack.

One extra challenge imposed by my testing suite was that the class file had
to be generated in the same way as the original compiler did. This is because
parsing the file into a convenient representation still needed to be serialized
exactly the same as it was originally. That meant I couldn't take shortcuts
with bytecode instruction generation; there are many short instructions for
encoding common constants, common local variables, and common stack manipulations.
So for example, parsing the bytecode turned "fconst_1" into a python float 1.0;
but serializing the bytecode, instead of the more general "ldc" opcode for
loading constants, the bytecode had to be serialized back into "fconst_1".
In this instance that is a simple check, however there are 20 special constant
opcodes, 40 special local variable loading and storing opcodes, 5 special
branches for comparing with zero, 4 variants of each arithmetic opcode, 5
variants of each array manipulation opcode, 3 different ways to create an
array, etc. The JVM's bytecode has a lot of redundancy that needs to be removed
for patches, and re-applied for serializing.

The library is currently being used by a patching harness based around
Minecraft's folder structure and the particular goal of mod adjustment.
However, the library was designed to stand on its own merits and is not
specific to Minecraft in any way.

version of Lua. However, I eventually lost the motivation to continue with
the project. It used a recursive-descent parser, which I was unable to make
safe in Rust. It also used a recursive expression evaluator, which was unsafe
due to possible stack overflows. At the time I didn't know there were
alternatives to recursive descent, and also got bogged down in the details of
memory management in the AST-walking code.

With my current knowledge of parsers and a better understanding of managing
complex algorithms, I think I would be able to complete this project. However
