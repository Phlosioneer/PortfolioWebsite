				<p><i>Penguin</i> was a small tile-based puzzle game I first made in my senior year of high school to help with college admissions. It was based on the sliding ice puzzles of Pokemon's ice caves. The player controlled a penguin that could walk over ground, and could slide over ice until it hit an object. The goal was to reach a door at the end of the level. Solutions involved paths that crossed over themselves multiple times.</p>
				<p>The project was done using Processing, a thin wrapper language around Java. It took approximately 20 hours to program and create assets. Unfortunately, the original copy has been lost over the years. Since then I've made another version very similar to the original, also in Processing.
