						<h2 class="subtitle">Build system hybrid between Make and Gradle</h2>
						<div class="content"><div class="markdown"><p><strong>JMaker</strong> was born from frustration with using Gradle for managing java
projects with nonstandard setups. Gradle's design prioritizes sane defaults, and
build files should only need to describe deviations from the default project
structure. This philosophy works excellently for pure-java projects, but runs into
problems if the project mixes in other languages or dynamically generated resources.
It also has a hard time running arbitrary code as part of its build files. Although
it uses a programming language to define them, it exposes an extremely small, minimal
API, that's often undocumented. Finally, it can have difficulties building an accurate
dependency graph for unusual project setups.</p>
<p>GNU Make has the opposite philosophy; it offers some defaults, but assumes very
little about how it's being used. However, makefiles are described using a very old
DSL with strange corner cases and limitations. Notably, it has extreme difficulties
handling commands, variable values, and file paths that include colons. The java
command-line compiler (javac) makes use of colons in many of its commands, so Make
has a hard time with java.</p>
<p>JMaker was an effort to make a tool that could leverage the strengths of each,
with fewer downsides. It would have used Lua to define its configuration and commands,
but use a rule-based production system like Make. That would allow it to have a clear
and well-defined dependency graph, with all the power of using an actual programming
language for build files.</p>
<p>I built JMaker as part of my <a href="blue_lagoon">Blue Lagoon</a> project. Gradle wasn't
able to understand some asset-generating scripts for tileset management. I got very
far with the project, but abandoned it at the same time that I stopped working on
Blue Lagoon.</p></div></div>
